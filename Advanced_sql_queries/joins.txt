There are 4 tyoes of join
    a.natural join
    a.left join
    a.right join
    a.full join

to practical all the above query we have to create db buyers and orders:

cmd to do so:
    Create the buyers table
        create table buyers 
            (
                customer_id int primary key,
                first_name varchar(50),
                last_name varchar(50)
            );

    Create the orders table
    create table orders 
        (
            order_id int primary key,
            customer_id int,
            order_date date,
            amount decimal(10, 2),
            foreign key (customer_id) references buyers(customer_id)
        );

 
 1.left join 
    include the row of matching row from both the tables and all rows of left table;

    QUERY:
        select * from buyers
        left join orders on buyers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;


 2.right join 
    include the row of matching row from both the tables and all rows of right table;

    QUERY:
        select * from buyers
        right join orders on buyers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;


 3.full join 
    include the row of matching row from both the tables otherwise null ;

    QUERY:
        select * from buyers
        full outer join orders on buyers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;

 4.natural join 
    include the rows both the tables;
