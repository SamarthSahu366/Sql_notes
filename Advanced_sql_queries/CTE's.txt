CTE's:
    just the temporary result set use to filter data;

    example: CTE for filtering, customers who ordered above 100.

    query:
        with customer_orders as 

        (
            select customer_id, first_name, last_name, amount
            from customers
            join orders on customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
        )

        select * from customer_orders
        where amount > 100;  

recursive queryies:
    keeps on calling itself, use stack data structure to call functions recursive.

    example:
        to get the emp with managers;

    query: 
        WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS 
            (
                SELECT employee_id, employee_name, manager_id
                FROM employees
                WHERE employee_name = 'Alice'
            
                UNION ALL
            
                //Recursive case: Get employees who report to the previously selected employees
                
                SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name, e.manager_id
                FROM employees e
                JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
            )
        
        SELECT * FROM EmployeeHierarchy;
