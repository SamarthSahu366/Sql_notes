SubQuery:
    A subquery is a query nested inside another query. 
    It is executed once, and its result is used by the outer query.

    example:
    select * from buyers
    where customer_id in (select customer_id from orders where amount > 100);


CorrelatedQuery:
    A correlated subquery is a subquery that references columns from the outer query. 
    It is executed for each outer query once.
    
    example:
    select * from buyers b
    where exists (
        select 1 from orders o
        where o.customer_id = b.customer_id and o.amount > 100
    );


Note: 
both work with three clauses i.e where,select,exists;
